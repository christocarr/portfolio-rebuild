### The problem

CVS Brent, an organization that provides community support, has a spreadsheet with over 1600 records they were using in their Social Isolation in Brent Initiative (SIBI). The initiative allows health care professionals help people that are isolated due to health problems, find social activities they might be interested in. Searching for a particular activity on a spreadsheet that contains 1600 entries is a tiresome process.

### The Solution

A responsive React web app that pulls in the spreadsheet data and allows the user to search for activities within an area of the patient's postcode.
