title: "Web Presence"

I read somewhere that to market myself as a web developer I needed a web presence, a portfolio of projects isn't enough so I thought that I would start a blog. "Oh no! Not another web development blog." I hear you moan. My blog won't be just the run of the mill tutorials like array methods map, filter, and reduce and things you've already read on other blogs, but instead I will share my experiences as a non-developer changing careers into a full time role. 

I'll blog about meetups and networking, interviews, assignments for interviews, and projects. 

Hope that other juniors and those looking to start a career as a web developer find my posts as insightful. And I hope that anyone who went through similar experiences can give constructive criticism and offer advice.

Stuck at a point wanting to do web development full time but don’t have the experience and working at a job where I can’t give my full attention to web development. Luckily I have 3 – 4 hours after work to spend time on web development.
