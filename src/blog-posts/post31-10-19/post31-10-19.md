I recently went to a coding workshop to get help from a coach with a project I was having a little difficulty with and to ask for some advice about my portfolio. We didn’t get time to discuss my portfolio but she was very helpful with showing me a workaround on the problem I had with implementing some code.

After everyone had a chance to mingle and get a bite to eat students were allocated to their coaches.  The average student to coach ratio I noticed was 2:1 which didn’t come to a surprise as a spot to any event to this meetup or workshop is in high demand. Now, I’m not complaining about the lack of coaches as I understand that this is a not for profit organisation and coaches volunteer their time. What grinds my gears is their eligibility criteria.

On their website it states: 

“Our workshops are available to woman, LGBT and people who are underrepresented in the tech industry”.

Does it mean that straight unbiased men are not welcome?
Not knowing this, I attended two of their workshops. Last night being the second over a month gap between the two. And strangely enough I get an email asking me to confirm that I belong to an eligible group. I replied and said I do not belong to a group. I could have lied and said I do, but then I would have been caught out because on their website there is this:

“If we determine that you have signed up and do not belong to an eligible group, we will permanently suspend your student invitations without warning.”

So, does this mean I will still get invitations to attend even though I’m 39 y/o straight man? Am I blacklisted never to attend ever? Don’t get me wrong I’m not against woman, LGBT, or people of colour working in tech. I'm all for diversity in any industry. I think I belong in the underrepresented group because of my age and in my opinion companies do not want to hire older people.
