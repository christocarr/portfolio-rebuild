I read somewhere that to market myself as a web developer I needed a web presence, a portfolio isnt enough so thought that I would start a blog. "Oh no! Not another web development blog." I hear you moan. My blog won't be just the run of the mill tutorials, array metods, and things you already read on other blogs, but mine will share my experainces as a junior developer changing career into a full time role. 

I'll blog about meetups and networking, interviews, assignments for interviews and projects. 

Hope that other juniors like myself can learn from my posts and anyone who went through something similar can give constructive criticism.

Freelancing

Not a designer and MVP

Design matters more to the man on the street 

Stuck at a point wanting to do web development full time but don’t have the experience and working at a job where I can’t give my full attention to web development. Luckily I have 3 – 4 hours after work to spend time on web development.


Point of this blog is to share my experiences as a junior developer going to interviews, meetups, and creating things. 
Hope that other juniors like myself can learn from my posts and anyone who went through something similar can give constructive criticism.
