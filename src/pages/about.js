      <h2>About me</h2>
      <h3>The Short</h3>
      <p>I'm an aspiring web designer and developer working in London, UK. I specialize in frontend development and love creating great user interactions.</p>
      <h3>The Long</h3>
      <p>Born in a little city called Pretoria in South Africa I came to the big old city of London to find better opportunities. Too comfortable with what was then great work but was literally killing me physically and I didn't see it as a chosen career path. I needed something else, something that I'll enjoy without breaking my back.</p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s when I looked further into web development as I frustratingly enjoyed building my photography website a few years before. To find out if I still enjoyed building things for the web, I then took part in Udacity's Google Developer Challenge Scholarship which I completed and then received and successfully completed a full six month Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship. Since I have not looked back and enjoy every minute.</p>
      <p>During the day I work as a compliance coordinator and in my spare time I create and build web sites and apps. Right now I enjoy developing using React and the JAMStack(a fullstack of sorts) and in the long term, if not already, I plan to become a fullstack developer. I'm open minded to
      learning new tech to keep myself open to job opportunities.</p>
