So I've been looking for junior web dev positions to start a career as developer for a while now and I read somewhere that to market myself as a developer, to make myself more appealing to recruiters and employers, I needed a web presence which is why I though of a new portfolio with a blog. Hope this makes sense.

A portfolio of projects isn't enough so I thought that I would start a blog. "Oh no! Not another web development blog." I hear you moan. My blog won't be just the run of the mill tutorials like array methods map, filter, and reduce and things you've already read on other blogs, but instead I will share my experience changing careers into a full time role. I'll blog about meetups and networking, interviews, assignments for the interview process, and projects I build along the way. 

Hope that other juniors and those looking to start a career as a web developer find my posts insightful, and I hope that anyone who went through similar experiences can give share theirs and give constructive criticism and offer advice. I've integrated Disqus to make this possible.
